Here's a sample letter:

Dear Gautam,

I just wanted to let you know that I've received your message and I'm ready to start working on your content requests. Please feel free to provide me with the necessary details and instructions for the task at hand.

Also, don't worry about the YouTube tab I had open - I've closed it now and I'm fully focused on our conversation.

What would you like me to work on first? A letter, code, application, or essay perhaps?

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best regards,
[Your Content Writer]
